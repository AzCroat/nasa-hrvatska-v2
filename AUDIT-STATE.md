# AUDIT-STATE.md — the running defect hunt

**READ THIS AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION, AND EVERY 20 MINUTES DURING ONE.**
It exists because findings that live in a conversation die with it. This file
is the only durable record of what has been checked, what it found, and — the
part that actually matters — **what has not been checked yet.**

Owner directive, 2026-09-22: *"There are no new sessions. All work must be
linked to any prior work. You can never lose anything."* The mechanism for that
is this file plus CLAUDE.md, both committed. Nothing is "remembered"; it is
written down or it does not exist. Never cite a session boundary as a reason
anything was lost — append here instead, before the work is done, not after.

## Rules for editing this file

- **Append, never rewrite.** A sweep that found nothing is a result worth
  keeping; deleting it invites someone to re-run it.
- **Record FALSE POSITIVES by name.** Half the cost of this hunt so far has
  been re-deriving that a thing is fine. A false positive recorded once is
  never chased twice.
- **State what a sweep CANNOT see.** Every guard here covers a class, and the
  uncovered classes are where the next field report comes from.
- **No claim without evidence.** Command run, count, and outcome — so a reader
  can re-run it rather than trust it.

## Sweeps completed

### 1. Router prop wiring — 2026-09-22 — NO DEFECTS
`/tmp` script walked `AppRouter.tsx`, resolved each lazy/static import to its
file, extracted the **default export's** destructured props, and diffed against
what the router actually passes.

- **382 components** rendered by the router.
- Findings: **1**, and it is dead code, not a defect — `LevelQuiz.onPass`
  (`src/components/learn/LevelQuiz.tsx:97`, `if (passed && onPass) onPass()`).
  LevelQuiz is rendered in exactly one place and `onPass` is never passed, so
  the branch has been dead for the life of the screen. **It costs nothing**:
  the pass is recorded by the surrounding block (`levelQuizPasses[levelNumber]`,
  XP, `markQuest`, `writeDelta`), and the "Level N+1 unlocked!" message is
  honest — `LearnPath.tsx:392` gates on `score >= 7` and the quiz passes at
  70% = 7/10.
- Ruled out as intended, do not re-chase: `ReviewScreen.allCats` (documented
  test-fixture override), `RetentionCheckScreen.lessons` (absent = fetch it
  yourself), `EquivalencyTestScreen.overrideLevel` (optional override),
  `PracticalCroatianScreen.stats` (`void stats;`, explicitly discarded).

**TOOL BUGS FOUND WHILE DOING THIS — both produced confident false findings:**
1. Matching a JSX element with `<Name(\s[^>]*?)?>` **truncates at the first
   `>`**, and `setTab={(id: string) => {…}}` contains one. That reported all 12
   of `HomeTab`'s props as unpassed when every one is passed. Scan with real
   brace/quote depth tracking instead.
2. Taking "the first function signature in the file" grabs an inner helper
   (`function Bar({ label, value, max, color, icon })`), not the default export.
   That produced 54 findings of which 42 were inner components.

### 2. Crash-on-open — 2026-09-22 — ALREADY COVERED, GREEN
`routeRenderSweep.test.tsx` + `contentShapeSweep.test.tsx`: **2 files, 8 tests,
passing.** Renders every route through the REAL router, cold and with the live
`/api/content/core` payload, asserting `ScreenErrorBoundary` never engages.
This is the `ScenesScreen` class (threw on every open for three weeks behind a
boundary, Sentry 0d68c47c) and it is closed.
**What it cannot see, in its own words:** *"a screen that renders fine and is
WRONG. The audio bug never threw — it returned a 400."*

### 3. Unreachable library code — 2026-09-22 — NO DEFECTS
Every `export` from `src/lib/**` and `src/hooks/**` checked for a non-test
consumer. This is the speaking-coach class (correct, tested, reachable by
nobody, dead for months).

- Real: `fbLoadSRS` (`src/lib/firebase.ts:656`) is dead — SRS **loading** is
  inlined at `firebase.ts:618`. Harmless duplicate.
- **FALSE POSITIVE — DO NOT RE-CHASE #1:** `src/lib/pushNotifications.ts` looks
  entirely unreferenced. It is reached by **dynamic** `import()` from `App.tsx:1267`,
  `useNotifications.ts:76,130`, `NotificationsSection.tsx:64,262` and
  `firebase.ts:727`. Static import scans cannot see it.
- **FALSE POSITIVE — DO NOT RE-CHASE #2:** `fbSaveSRS` looks uncalled, which
  would mean SRS progress never syncs. **It is called**, at `firebase.ts:341`,
  inside `fbSaveProgress` in the same file. A `grep -v firebase.ts` used to
  drop the definition also dropped the call site. SRS sync works.

---

### 4. AI endpoints, end to end — 2026-09-22 — **3 REAL DEFECTS, FIXED**

Enumerated from `ENDPOINT_CEILING_MICROUSD` (the canonical list) by IMPORTING
the module, not re-parsing it. **30 endpoints**, every one with a handler file.

**THE DEFECT: a learner was shown the server's machine code.** The gate refuses
with `fail(status, code)` whose body is `{ error: '<code>' }`.
`MicroLessonScreen` threw that string and rendered it verbatim:

    throw new Error(body.error || `Server error ${res.status}`)
    setErrorMsg((e as Error).message || 'Could not generate lesson…')

The fallback never fired, because `body.error` is always present. A learner who
hit the daily quota — or was simply signed out — read `monthly_budget_exhausted`
or `unauthenticated` under "Something went wrong", above an unconditional
**"Try Again"** that could not work until the cap reset. Two siblings, same
class, milder: `DailyListeningCard` (Home) told every cause "Try again", and
`DialogueSim` blamed the tutor ("Could not reach Maja") for a billing cap. None
of the three reported to Sentry, so none would ever have named itself.

All three now classify through `lib/aiFailure` (`failureFromResponse` /
`failureFromError` -> one honest sentence + `retryable`), report to Sentry, and
MicroLessonScreen only offers a retry that can actually succeed.

**Why the 2026-09-07 feedback census missed it**: that census scoped itself to
surfaces promising feedback on WRITING or SPEECH and traced those end to end. A
micro-lesson is neither. The rule it broke is in CLAUDE.md twice — "NEVER show a
learner a raw status" and layer 10's "EVERY AI surface renders the budget pause
as a calm message, never a retryable error."

Pinned by `aiRefusalMessages.test.tsx` (10), driving the REAL screen against the
gate's real refusal shape. Mutation-verified, four, each confirmed landed:
the original bug restored -> 5 fail; the retry made unconditional -> 1;
DailyListeningCard reverted -> 1; DialogueSim reverted -> 1.

**Orphaned, recorded, not urgent:** `/api/daily-culture`, `/api/daily-plan` and
`/api/adaptive-insights` have handlers, budget ceilings and prompt
instrumentation but NO caller anywhere. #682 deleted the client modules for the
latter two as unreachable and left the endpoints behind. Nothing calls them, so
nothing can fail for a learner. (`golden-calibration` and `stt-calibration` also
have no client caller — correct, they are dispatch-only from workflows.)

**FALSE POSITIVE — DO NOT RE-CHASE #3:** `croatiaPool.ts` and `sessionPools.ts`
appear to call `/api/news` and `/api/micro-lesson`. They are COMMENTS naming the
route beside a pool entry. **#4:** the four `explain-error` drills
(ClozeEngine, McGame, ReviewScreen, DictationScreen) have no classifier by
DESIGN — fail-soft, the authored tip stays on screen.

**TOOL BUG #3:** a string regex `["']([^"']{10,90})["']` silently drops every
message containing an apostrophe — including "Could not load today's listening
exercise", the finding it was written to catch. **#4:** `getByText(/Try Again/i)`
matched both the button AND the sentence "…Try again in a moment", a strict-mode
violation that failed a CORRECT fix. Query by ROLE.

### 5. Numbers displayed vs numbers measured (NEVER-DO 13) — 2026-09-22 — CLEAN

Traced every figure a learner reads back to the thing that produced it. **No
defects.** Recorded so nobody re-runs it:

- `getCategoryStatus` (adaptive.ts:736) correctly returns `accuracy: null` while
  `lastSeen === 0`. The 0.5 EWMA seed is never surfaced as a result — and **no
  component reads the store directly**, so the guard cannot be bypassed.
- `readinessForVerification` buckets strong / developing / **untested** and
  requires `n >= MIN_SAMPLES` before claiming either of the first two.
- `WeakWordsPanel` computes `errorRate = w / (r + w)` over cards with >= 2 real
  reviews.
- **The CEFR badge holds.** All six display surfaces — DesktopPanel,
  heroHelpers, StatsTab, CertificateScreen, InsightsTab, LearnTab — resolve
  through `getDisplayLevel`. None reaches for `getCertifiedLevel` or
  `getEffectiveLevelForUnlock` (which count provisional passes). This number has
  broken twice; it is currently correct.

### 6. CLAUDE.md's own file paths — 2026-09-22 — **3 STALE, FIXED**

Found while checking #5: the orientation document, read at the start of every
session, named **three files that do not exist** (of 79 paths).

    src/data/content.jsx                 -> content.tsx
    src/components/profile/StatsTab.jsx  -> StatsTab.tsx
    migrations/ai_month_spend.sql        -> never existed

The third had propagated INTO PRODUCTION SOURCE: `_aiBudget.js` claimed in two
comments that the file "remains as documentation of the schema". The
`ai_month_spend` schema is `CREATE_LEDGER_SQL` inside that same file and
self-migrates; `migrations/` holds `ai_quota` and `ai_burst` only. Nothing
breaks — it just sends a reader somewhere empty, which is how the nav-tab table
stayed wrong for five months.

Now a MECHANISM: `claudeMdPaths.test.ts` checks every path CLAUDE.md names, with
an anti-vacuity floor. Mutation-verified, two: the stale `StatsTab.jsx` restored
fails 1; the path regex neutered fails 1 (the floor).
**It cannot see a filename mentioned WITHOUT a directory** — `InsightsTab` is
named bare, so a rename of that file would still slip through. Matching bare
component names would drag every prose noun in, so paths is the honest scope.
(I first reported `InsightsTab.jsx` as stale too; it is only ever written bare.
Corrected before it reached the file.)

### 7. Day one — the first-ever session — 2026-09-22 — COVERED, with one stated residual

Probed by building a real session for a zero-state learner (no stats, no SRS
queue, no cached curriculum spine). Raw result:

    1. cat_genitive            2. dialogue
    3. listeningComprehension  4. cityofday      (no lesson)

**That is NOT a live defect, and the probe is why it looked like one.** Calling
`buildSessionActivities` directly bypasses `useTeachingSlotRetry`, which is
exactly the fix for this, shipped the same day (#698). An absent spine correctly
yields `[]` from `buildCurriculumSlots` (the documented null contract); the
retry rebuilds the plan once the spine's own write fires
`CURRICULUM_SPINE_EVENT`.

Verified WIRED, not just present — this repo's recurring failure:
`useDailySession.ts:918` mounts it, `curriculumProgress.ts:98` dispatches the
event inside `writeCurriculumSpine`, and `teachingSlotRetry.test.tsx:200` pins
the mount by source.

**RESIDUAL, deliberate and documented in the hook**: the retry refuses a session
the learner has already STARTED. So a learner who taps an activity before the
spine lands (~6 s on the measured trace) keeps the lesson-less plan for that
whole day. The hook states the trade — re-rolling a started session is the
2026-05-21 "I did my activities but the card forgot" incident, judged strictly
worse than a missing lesson. Recorded as a known cost, not a bug.

**Worth knowing for the next probe:** `pickSessionLesson` is NOT a builder
fallback. It lives in `useScreenLauncher` and only chooses WHICH lesson once an
`animlesson` screen launches. With no spine, a lesson reaches a learner only by
winning a P3 fill slot against ~100 pool entries — the pre-2026-08-28 behaviour.

### 8. Every AI surface's refusal copy — 2026-09-22 — **1 MORE DEFECT, FIXED**

Finishing sweep 4, which fixed 3 of the 25 surfaces it flagged. Two targeted
hunts over ALL of `src/`, not just the files already open.

**(a) A server error code rendered to a learner** — one hit outside the three
already fixed: `ContactScreen.tsx:143` (`setError(data.error || …)`).
**FALSE POSITIVE — DO NOT RE-CHASE #5:** identical code shape, different
CONTRACT. `/api/contact` returns human sentences by design ("Too many requests.
Please wait a minute.", "Invalid email address."), not machine codes, so
rendering them is correct.

**(b) Copy that blames the learner's connection** — one real defect:
`GrammarDiagnosisScreen` told EVERY failure *"Try again when you have internet
access."* A quota 429 or a budget 503 is a server condition, so a learner who
had hit the daily AI limit was sent to check their router. CLAUDE.md forbids
this by name — "imply learner fault for a server condition" — and records the
same shape elsewhere ("the graded reader said 'check your connection' to a
signed-out learner"). It also offered an unconditional retry. Now classified
through `lib/aiFailure`, reported to Sentry, and the retry follows `retryable`.

Mutation-verified, two: the "internet access" copy restored fails 1; the
classifier dropped fails 1.

**Verified CORRECT and deliberately left alone** (all four looked like hits):
- `AIConversation.tsx:476` — "check your connection" fires only from the
  transport's own `catch`; `!res.ok` is classified separately through
  `classifyAiLimit`, with 401 / budget / burst distinguished.
- `PronunciationScorer.tsx:212` — switches on the Web Speech recogniser's OWN
  `code === 'network'`. Accurate, and a model of how to do this.
- `PostcardScreen.tsx:283` — already fixed by the 2026-09-07 census, with a
  comment citing the same directive.
- The offline notices in `AIConversation`, `LiveTutorScreen`,
  `CroatianNewsScreen` etc. are gated on real offline state.

**So the 2026-09-07 census fixed some surfaces and missed others** — it scoped
to writing/speech feedback. Four surfaces outside that scope have now been
brought up to the same standard.

### 9. A real browser walk — 2026-09-22 — CLEAN, plus a near-miss worth more than the walk

Built the app and drove Chromium through a cold open and all five tabs as a
guest. **0 error boundaries, 0 uncaught exceptions, 0 unexpected HTTP failures.**
Login renders, every tab renders, nothing throws.

**THE NEAR-MISS. I almost shipped a fix for a bug that does not exist in
production, and the commit message would have been confident.**

Observed: a guest's first session was `Genitive | Guided Speaking | Listening |
City of the Day` — **no lesson** — and the app made NO request for
`/api/content/curriculum` at any point. Traced to `App.tsx:1152`,
`if (!authUser || authScreen !== 'app') return;`, with a perfect precedent
sitting in the same file: the auto-save effect's comment records being fixed for
exactly this, because a legacy guest has `authUser === null`.

**IT WAS AN ARTIFACT OF MY OWN ENVIRONMENT.** This sandbox has no
`VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, so "Continue as Guest" fell back to
`enterLegacyGuest()` — the path taken ONLY when anonymous auth is unavailable. A
normal guest goes through `signInAnonymously`, which useAuth says "drives
setAuthUser / _syncReady / setAuthScreen('app') through the same path as any
signed-in user". A real guest HAS `authUser`; the spine IS fetched.

**AND THE FIX WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED EITHER.** `/api/content/curriculum` goes
through `authedRead`, which 401s without a Firebase token (`_authedRead.js:57`).
A legacy guest has no token, so dropping the guard adds a request that fails and
changes nothing a learner sees. Reverted.

**TOOL BUG #5:** I grepped `curriculum.js` for `requireAuth|verifyToken|Bearer|401`,
found nothing, and concluded the endpoint was unauthenticated. The auth lives in
the `authedRead` HELPER. Grepping a handler for auth keywords does not tell you
whether it is gated — follow the helper.

**A TRAP FOR THE NEXT WALK, and the reusable part:** a local walk without
Firebase config exercises the LEGACY-GUEST fallback, not the path real users
take. Anything concluded from it about "guests" is about a degraded fallback.
Also: `vite preview` has no Pages Functions and answers unknown paths with the
SPA fallback (index.html, 200), so `/api/content/*` "succeeds" with HTML that
fails to parse — the walk runs with NO CONTENT AT ALL, which is itself a
degraded path.

**CLOSED BY THE OWNER, 2026-09-22, ON THE REAL DEPLOYMENT.** They opened the
Cloudflare branch preview as a guest: the first activity was **the genitive
TEACHING LESSON**, followed by the genitive drill. P0 works, the spine arrives,
the coupling serves the lesson and then its practice. There is no defect, and
the revert above was correct.

**THE LABEL IS WHY IT LOOKED OTHERWISE, and it is a real trap.** A curriculum
lesson slot is labelled with the LESSON'S OWN TITLE
(`curriculumSlot.ts:137`, `label: step.entry.title`, screen `animlesson`), so a
genitive lesson renders as "Genitive" — visually IDENTICAL to `cat_genitive`,
the drill. Reading a session card's labels cannot tell a lesson from a drill;
only the `screen`/`id` can. My local probe produced the drill (no content at
all), and I then read the owner's two-word confirmation as agreeing with the
drill reading rather than asking which it was — fitting their evidence to my
hypothesis. **Never diagnose session composition from labels; dump `id` and
`screen`.**

NEVER re-open this without evidence naming the `id`/`screen`, not the label.

**AND THE FULL ANSWER, VERIFIED IN-REPO RATHER THAN BY ASKING ANYONE.** Driving
the REAL builder against the REAL spine (`CURRICULUM` written through
`writeCurriculumSpine`, no mocks beyond SRS/CEFR) a fresh A1 learner gets:

    1. curriculum_alphabet           screen=animlesson
    2. curriculum_practice_alphabet  screen=alphabet
    3. dialogue
    4. cityofday

Spine order 1 is `alphabet`, and that is what is served — lesson first, then its
coupled practice. P0 and the teach->practice coupling are correct end to end. A
learner seeing GENITIVE first simply has prior progress and the spine has
advanced them past the early lessons, which is the system working.

**The earlier local probe showed a drill for one reason only: no spine and no
content.** That is the degraded path, not a defect, and it took writing the real
spine into the probe to see it. When a probe's answer surprises you, check what
you failed to give it before concluding anything about the code.

### 10. Work that grades but never credits — 2026-09-22 — CLEAN

The inverse of the `AlphabetScreen` award bug: a screen that scores a learner
and then pays them nothing. Swept every component that tracks a score AND
reaches a finish state, checking for any credit call.

Six flagged, **all six false positives, zero defects**: `ConditionalScreen`,
`DeclensionScreen`, `FormalRegisterScreen`, `FutureTenseLessonScreen`,
`ImpersonalScreen`, `LessonQuiz` all credit through `completeLesson()` from
`hooks/useLessonCompletion`, and four also forward `award` down to a child
rather than calling it.

**TOOL BUG #6:** the detector's credit-name list
(`completeExercise|award|awardFn|recordScreenPractised|markQuest`) did not
include `completeLesson` — the helper the entire hand-written lesson family uses
— nor did it count `award={award}` prop FORWARDING as crediting. An incomplete
list of names to look for reads exactly like a finding.

**AND A CORRECTION MADE MID-SWEEP:** I flagged `LessonQuiz` as not awarding
while "remembering" having read `award(xpAward, false, 'grammar')` in it earlier
today. That line is in **`LevelQuiz.tsx`** — a different file with a similar
name. Two components one letter apart, and only re-reading the file settled it.
`LessonQuiz` (shared quiz block, credits via `completeLesson`) and `LevelQuiz`
(the level test, credits via `award` + `levelQuizPasses`) are not the same thing.

### 11. What actually watches production — 2026-09-22 — **THE STRUCTURAL GAP**

Not a bug. The reason bugs reach the owner.

`production-smoke.yml` runs twice daily (08:00/20:00 UTC) across four browsers
against nasahrvatska.com. **All 16 of its tests are INFRASTRUCTURE**: HTTP 200,
the title, not-a-Cloudflare-block, root-not-blank, content within 25 s, no JS
crash on load, entry module served as JavaScript, service worker, three icons,
assetlinks.json. It never signs in, never opens a lesson, never plays audio,
never requests feedback.

**So the only thing watching production checks that the site SERVES, not that it
TEACHES.** Every defect the owner reported in the field passes all sixteen,
twice a day, indefinitely — the B2 listening section that played nothing,
`monthly_budget_exhausted` rendered raw, the badge claiming an unmeasured level,
"check your internet" for a quota cap. With no automated check that a learner
can learn, THE OWNER IS THE INTEGRATION TEST. That is the mechanism behind
"you said it was done and then spent days fixing bugs".

`full-user-audit` (16 tests) and `user-experience-audit` (9) DO cover the real
flow — and are `test.skip`ped in CI, correctly: they drive the live site with a
real account and no workflow holds credentials (the e2e job runs hermetically
with `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY: 'placeholder'`). **FALSE POSITIVE — DO NOT
RE-CHASE #6:** those skips are right; the gap is that nothing unattended covers
the flow, not that those specs are wrongly disabled.

**THE FIX SHIPPED:** `e2e/learner-flow.smoke.spec.js`, wired into
`playwright.smoke.config.js` by an EXPLICIT list (a `*smoke.spec.js` glob would
drag in `alka-smoke` and `map-smoke`, neither a production check). Four tests on
the GUEST path, which needs no credentials and so can run unattended forever: a
guest can enter; today's plan holds a real activity count with no error
boundary; the first activity opens and renders; and the run itself never calls a
generating endpoint.

Two costs, designed for rather than discovered: it is pinned to ONE browser
(2 anonymous Firebase users/day, not 8), and the fourth test fails if any of 13
Claude endpoints is called, so a future edit cannot quietly bill the $10/month
cap 60 times a month.

**TOOL BUG #7 — IN THE SPEC I JUST WROTE.** The first draft did
`test.skip(!(await begin.isVisible()), 'no Begin Session control')`. On a re-run
where the session was already started that control reads differently, so the
test SILENTLY SKIPPED (`1 skipped, 3 passed`) — a guard that disappears exactly
when state differs. Home must always offer a way in, so absence is now an
ASSERTION, not a skip. Caught only by running it twice and reading the skip
count.

Mutation-verified, two: an endpoint the app really calls added to the spend list
fails the budget test (proving the watcher fires, not just that it is silent);
an impossible activity count fails the plan test.

## NOT YET CHECKED — where the next field report will come from

Every defect the owner has actually hit is in this list, not the one above.
None of them crash, so no sweep above can see any of them.

- [ ] **Behavioural correctness on live paths.** Renders fine, behaves wrong.
      (Credit-on-grade is closed — sweep 10.)
- [x] ~~LOW: `AIConversation` appended the raw `Error.message`~~ — FIXED. Both
      sites (:476/:593) drop the parenthetical and keep `cause` for diagnostics.
      The AbortError branch is untouched: its wording was already correct and
      context-appropriate, and reclassifying it through `failureFromError` would
      have swapped a right sentence for one that says "evaluator" in a
      conversation screen. Mutation-verified (M9: the parenthetical restored
      fails 1).
      The B2 listening section returned 400; the badge claimed C1 for a level
      nothing measured; feedback surfaces rendered nothing on failure.
- [~] **Day-one path**: the LESSON half is checked (sweep 7, covered). Still
      open: placement -> first drill -> audio -> feedback on a zero-state
      account.
- [x] ~~**Numbers displayed vs numbers measured** (NEVER-DO 13)~~ — DONE, see
      sweep 5. Clean. (This line sat unticked for one checkpoint after the sweep
      that closed it: the list and the findings are two places to remember, and
      a queue that disagrees with its own results is how the nav-tab table
      happened. Tick it in the SAME commit as the sweep.)
- [x] ~~**API endpoints' real failure modes** as a learner meets them~~ — DONE,
      sweeps 4 and 8. Four surfaces fixed; the rest verified correct by name.
- [x] ~~**Offline / stale-payload behaviour**~~ — PARTLY. The cold sweep already
      primes content as absent, so a MISSING key is covered both ways
      (`content?.K` and `(content ?? {}).K`). The uncovered case is a key
      PRESENT with an OLDER shape, which needs an old payload snapshot the repo
      does not keep. Stated rather than faked.
- [x] ~~**Anonymous-auth / guest lesson question**~~ — CLOSED by the owner on
      the real deployment: a guest's first activity is the genitive TEACHING
      LESSON, then its drill. No defect. See sweep 9.
- [ ] Lower priority: `fbLoadSRS` removal; `LevelQuiz.onPass` removal.
